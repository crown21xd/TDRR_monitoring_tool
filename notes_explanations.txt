Success Rate Explanation

step 1: Matrix Dimension Verification
results.BER_compliant and results.BER_noncompliant are both 1 x length(snr_dB_list) vectors (e.g., 1x26 for SNR from -5 to 20 dB).
The comparison results.BER_compliant > results.BER_noncompliant yields a logical vector of the same size.
mean() computes the fraction (scalar), multiplied by 100 for %. No uneven matrices or dimension errors—element-wise operations are valid.
Step 2: Metric Explanation and Rationale
What It Measures: The success rate is the percentage of SNR points where the BER after mitigating the noncompliant jammer is lower than after mitigating the compliant jammer. Since both are jammers (with mitigation applied), it quantifies when your subspace-based method (designed for the harder noncompliant case) outperforms the standard mitigation for the easier compliant case.
Why This Comparison? Compliant jammers follow OFDM rules, making them simpler to null via projection matrices. Noncompliant jammers violate CP, spreading interference and requiring more robust estimation. A high success rate indicates your method excels in challenging scenarios, demonstrating adaptability for TVWS monitoring where jammer types vary.
Step 3: How to Defend It in Your Thesis Defense
Clear Definition: "The success rate measures the fraction of SNR values where mitigation of cyclic prefix-violating jammers yields lower BER than mitigation of OFDM-compliant jammers. Both scenarios involve jammers, but the comparison highlights superiority in handling the more disruptive type."

Justification:

Practical Relevance: In real TVWS systems, jammers aren't absent—they're either compliant or noncompliant. This metric shows when your system mitigates the tougher case better, validating the subspace estimation (SVD-based) for spread interference.
Link to Theory: Reference the paper: "Noncompliant jammers resemble multi-antenna interference; our projection nulling reduces BER more effectively here, as evidenced by the success rate."
Statistical Insight: Averaging over SNR accounts for noise variation, providing a robust summary. For example, if success_rate = 70%, it means in 70% of SNR points, noncompliant mitigation wins.
Addressing Criticisms:

Criticism: "Why compare jammers instead of to jammerless?" Response: "Jammerless is ideal but unrealistic—our focus is jammer-present performance. Comparing jammer types isolates mitigation strengths, directly supporting the paper's claim on jammer resemblance."
Criticism: "It's relative, not absolute." Response: "True, but relative metrics are standard in comparative studies (e.g., in MIMO literature). We supplement with absolute BER averages for completeness."
Criticism: "What if BERs are similar?" Response: "Success rate approaches 50%, indicating no advantage—still informative. Our simulations show [insert your data], proving differentiation."
Supporting Evidence:

Show BER plots (Figure 1 in your code): Point to regions where noncompliant curve dips below compliant.
Report averages: "Average BER_noncompliant: X, compliant: Y—success rate Z% quantifies when X < Y."
If needed, add per-trial variant: As in my previous suggestion, compute success per trial for added granularity.

fig 4,5 an 6 Explanation 

These visualize the signal magnitudes after subcarrier assignment for jammerless, compliant jammer, and noncompliant jammer scenarios. I'll cover how the data is obtained, why "Used Subcarrier Index" is used for the x-axis, alternative x-axes, and ensure matrix dimensions are correct (no uneven issues). This ties into OFDM principles: subcarriers are the frequency bins where data is modulated.

Step 1: How the Data for These Plots Is Obtained
Data Source: The plots use plot_signal_jammerless, plot_signal_compliant, and plot_signal_noncompliant, captured at a specific point in the simulation (trial 1, SNR = max(snr_dB_list), OFDM symbol 1) for illustration. This is set in the code around line ~180:

if trial_index == 1 && snr_index == length(snr_dB_list) && ofdm_symbol_index == 1
    plot_signal_jammerless = y_jammerless_frequency_tones;
    plot_signal_compliant = y_jammer_compliant_frequency_tones;
    plot_signal_noncompliant = y_jammer_noncompliant_frequency_tones;
end
y_jammerless_frequency_tones is the jammerless received signal in frequency domain, selected only for used subcarriers: y_jammerless_frequency_tones = y_jammerless_frequency(:, used_subcarrier_indices, :); (line ~190).
Similarly for compliant and noncompliant, which include jammer interference.
These are complex matrices of size (num_receive_antennas, num_used_subcarriers, num_ofdm_symbols) (e.g., 1x48x50 for your params).
Processing for Plot: abs(squeeze(plot_signal_jammerless(1, :, 1))) takes the magnitude of the first receive antenna, first OFDM symbol, across all used subcarriers. This gives a real vector of size 1 x num_used_subcarriers (e.g., 1x48), representing signal strength per subcarrier.
Why This Snapshot? It's a representative example (high SNR, first trial) to show subcarrier-level effects without averaging over trials/SNRs, which would obscure frequency-domain patterns.
Step 2: Why "Used Subcarrier Index" for the X-Axis?
Rationale: The x-axis is 1:num_used_subcarriers (e.g., 1 to 48), indexing the used subcarriers only. In OFDM, not all subcarriers carry data—unused ones (e.g., DC, guard bands) are zero or null. Plotting only used subcarriers focuses on where signal energy is present, avoiding flat-zero regions.
used_subcarrier_indices = [-26:-22, -20:-8, -6:-1, 1:6, 8:20, 22:26] + 32; defines the active subcarriers (shifted for 1-based indexing in MATLAB). This is standard for LTE-like systems (e.g., 48 used out of 64 total).
Plotting the full 64 subcarriers would show most points as zero, making the plot uninformative. "Used Subcarrier Index" emphasizes data-bearing tones, highlighting jammer impact (e.g., noncompliant spreads energy).
Matrix Compatibility: The vector length matches num_used_subcarriers—no dimension mismatches.
Step 3: Alternative X-Axis Options
Yes, other x-axes can provide different insights, depending on what you want to emphasize. Here are options, with code snippets to modify the plots:

Actual Subcarrier Numbers (e.g., -26 to 26):

Why? Shows the physical subcarrier positions (relative to DC), useful for seeing symmetry or guard band effects.
Code Modification:

subcarrier_nums = used_subcarrier_indices - 32;  % Shift back to -26 to 26
figure(4)
plot(subcarrier_nums, abs(squeeze(plot_signal_jammerless(1,:,1))), 'LineWidth', 2, 'Color', 'blue')
xlabel('Subcarrier Number','FontSize',12)
% Same for Figures 5 and 6
Advantage: Intuitive for frequency-domain analysis; matches OFDM specs.
Frequency in Hz (Relative to Carrier):

Why? Converts subcarrier index to actual frequency, accounting for subcarrier spacing (e.g., 15 kHz in LTE).
Code Modification (assuming subcarrier_spacing = 15e3; % Hz):

subcarrier_spacing = 15e3;  % Example: 15 kHz
freq_axis = (used_subcarrier_indices - 32) * subcarrier_spacing / 1e6;  % MHz relative to carrier
figure(4)
plot(freq_axis, abs(squeeze(plot_signal_jammerless(1,:,1))), 'LineWidth', 2, 'Color', 'blue')
xlabel('Frequency (MHz relative to carrier)','FontSize',12)
% Same for Figures 5 and 6
Advantage: Physical units; useful for real-world interpretation (e.g., jammer bandwidth).
Normalized Frequency (0 to 1):

Why? Scales to the full bandwidth, showing relative positions.
Code Modification:

norm_freq = (used_subcarrier_indices - 32) / (num_subcarriers / 2);  % -1 to 1, but clipped to used
figure(4)
plot(norm_freq, abs(squeeze(plot_signal_jammerless(1,:,1))), 'LineWidth', 2, 'Color', 'blue')
xlabel('Normalized Frequency','FontSize',12)
% Same for Figures 5 and 6
Advantage: Dimensionless; good for comparing different FFT sizes.
Choose based on your audience: "Used Subcarrier Index" is simple for code-focused explanations; frequency axes for signal processing defenses.

Step 4: Additional Notes
Interpretation: Jammerless shows clean data tones. Compliant jammer affects specific subcarriers (OFDM-like). Noncompliant spreads energy (CP violation), as per the paper.
Matrix Check: All squeezes yield vectors of length num_used_subcarriers—even dimensions.
Refinement: Add legends or average over symbols for smoother plots.

fig 8 explanations

This figure uses imagesc to visualize the average jammer signal magnitudes in the frequency domain, comparing compliant and noncompliant jammers. I'll cover the x/y labels, how the data is computed (with matrix dimension checks), and why this representation is chosen. This ties into subspace estimation for mitigation, as the plots highlight how jammer energy distributes across subcarriers and antennas.

Step 1: Overview of Figure 8
Purpose: The figure shows two subplots (top: compliant jammer; bottom: noncompliant jammer) as heatmaps of average jammer signal magnitude. Darker colors indicate higher energy. This illustrates jammer interference patterns: compliant jammers concentrate energy (OFDM-like), while noncompliant spread it (CP violation), supporting the paper's thesis on jammer resemblance to multi-antenna systems.
Data Source: From jammer_compliant_freq_domain and jammer_noncompliant_freq_domain, which store jammer-only signals per trial, subcarrier, antenna, and OFDM symbol.
Step 2: How the Data Is Computed
Original Matrices:
jammer_compliant_freq_domain: Size (num_trials, num_used_subcarriers, num_receive_antennas, num_ofdm_symbols) (e.g., 100x48x1x50 for your params). Each element is the complex jammer signal at that point.
Same for jammer_noncompliant_freq_domain.
Averaging Steps:
abs(jammer_compliant_freq_domain): Takes magnitude (real, non-negative) of complex values.
mean(..., 4): Averages over the 4th dimension (OFDM symbols), resulting in (num_trials, num_used_subcarriers, num_receive_antennas). This smooths temporal variations.
mean(..., 1): Averages over the 1st dimension (trials), resulting in (1, num_used_subcarriers, num_receive_antennas). This provides statistical average across channel realizations.
Final for Plot: squeeze(jammer_compliant_avg) removes singleton dimensions, yielding (num_used_subcarriers, num_receive_antennas) (e.g., 48x1). imagesc treats this as a 2D matrix for the heatmap.
Matrix Compatibility Check: All operations preserve dimensions—no uneven matrices. For example, averaging reduces dimensions predictably, and squeeze handles singletons safely.
Step 3: X and Y Labels Explained
Y-Axis: "Subcarrier Index" (1 to num_used_subcarriers, e.g., 1 to 48):
This is the row index of the matrix, corresponding to each used subcarrier (from used_subcarrier_indices). It shows jammer energy per frequency bin.
Why? Subcarriers are the key in OFDM—plotting energy distribution here reveals if the jammer affects all tones (noncompliant) or specific ones (compliant).
X-Axis: "Receive Antenna" (1 to num_receive_antennas, e.g., 1 to 1):
This is the column index, corresponding to each receive antenna. In your SISO case (num_receive_antennas=1), it's a single column, but the code supports MIMO.
Why? Antennas capture spatial interference. For MIMO, this would show per-antenna jammer strength, aiding subspace analysis (e.g., SVD for nulling).
Colorbar: Represents magnitude (e.g., signal strength in linear units), with higher values in warmer colors.
Step 4: Why This Visualization?
Insight: Compliant jammers (top) often show concentrated energy (diagonal-like in MIMO), while noncompliant (bottom) show spread patterns, mimicking multi-antenna interference. This justifies subspace projection for mitigation.
Averaging Rationale: Averaging over trials/symbols reduces noise, focusing on typical behavior. Without it, plots would be noisy and hard to interpret.
Alternative Representations:
Line Plots per Antenna: Instead of heatmap, plot magnitude vs. subcarrier for each antenna (e.g., plot(1:num_used_subcarriers, jammer_compliant_avg(:,1))). Better for 1D views.
3D Surface: Use surf for MIMO cases to show antenna-subcarrier interactions.
Frequency Axis: Change y-label to actual subcarrier numbers (as in my previous response) for physical meaning.
